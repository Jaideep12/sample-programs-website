Welcome to the Palindromic Number page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

A palindrome number is a number that reads the same backward and forward.
Example: 343, 121, 909, 222


## Requirements

Create a file called "Palindrome Number" using the naming convention appropriate for your language of choice.
Write a program that accepts an input of an integer and prints whether the number is a palindrome or not.


## Testing

Every project in the Sample Programs repo should be tested. In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Palindromic Number. To keep things simple, we split up testing into two subsets: valid and invalid. Valid tests refer to tests that occur under correct input conditions. Invalid tests refer to tests that occur on bad input (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

### Valid Tests

No 'Valid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).

### Invalid Tests

No 'Invalid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).
