Welcome to the Factorial page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

The factorial of an integer `n` is defined as:

`n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x ... x n`

With the special case `0! = 1`.


## Requirements

You must write an executable program that accepts an integer `n` on standard
input via the command line, and outputs `n!` to standard output.

Note that the factorial function grows very quickly. For example, `4! = 24`
but `8! = 40320`. Therefore, you should impose a limit on the input, so that
the largest factorial still fits into your language's largest supported datatype.

Also note that the factorial is not defined for negative integers.


## Testing

Every project in the Sample Programs repo should be tested. In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Factorial. To keep things simple, we split up testing into two subsets: valid and invalid. Valid tests refer to tests that occur under correct input conditions. Invalid tests refer to tests that occur on bad input (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

### Valid Tests

No 'Valid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).

### Invalid Tests
