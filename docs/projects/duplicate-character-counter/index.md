Welcome to the Duplicate Character Counter page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

Although a one line solution for this problem is feasible, just as 
huge brute force solutions are, we should avoid both of these 
approaches. Instead, our goal should be to find a fine line between 
both, where the code is not bogged down but is largely readable and 
maintainable.


## Requirements

The code should return the count of all duplicate, case-insensitive, 
alphanumeric characters, that occur more than once in the given string. 
Characters should also be presented in the order in which they appear 
in the string. For instance, 'abba' should output 'a' as the firstcharacter 
that has a duplicate.


## Testing

| Description   |     Input      |          Output          |
| :------------ | :------------: | :----------------------: |
| Basic String  | "goodbyeblues" | o: 2<br />b: 2<br />e: 2 |
| Correct Order |     "abba"     |      a: 2<br />b: 2      |
| Case Distinct |     "aAbB"     | No duplicate characters  |
