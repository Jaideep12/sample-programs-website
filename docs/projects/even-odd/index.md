Welcome to the Even Odd page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

An even number is an integer which is "evenly divisible" by two. This
means that if the integer is divided by 2, it yields no remainder.

An odd number is an integer which is not evenly divisible by two. This
means that if the integer is divided by 2, it yields a remainder of 1.


## Requirements

Create a file called "Even Odd" using the naming
convention appropriate for your language of choice.

Write a sample program which accepts an integer on the command line and
outputs if the integer is Even or Odd.


## Testing

Every project in the Sample Programs repo should be tested. In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Projects. To keep things simple, we split up testing into two subsets: valid and invalid. Valid tests refer to tests that occur under correct input conditions. Invalid tests refer to tests that occur on bad input (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

### Valid Tests

No 'Valid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).

### Invalid Tests

No 'Invalid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).
