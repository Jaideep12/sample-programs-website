Welcome to the Fraction Math page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

Languages like python have built-in utilities or functions for working with fractions.
Many of these fractions functions follow a similar pattern across programming languages: 
takes a numerator and a denomenator as an attribute.
Perform basic arithmatic and relational operations with operator overloading.


## Requirements

In general, a fractions library should perform the following:

1. Perform arithmatic operation like multiplications, addition etc.
2. Give output for relational operations like >=, >, == etc.

More specifically, begin with creating object instance of fraction class with two attributes:
numerator and denomenator.Using operator overloading feature of langauge implement basic arithmatic
and relational operaions.

For instance `./fraction-math "6/2" "+" "1/4"` would output `13/4`

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't supply any input.


## Testing

Every project in the Sample Programs repo should be tested. In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Projects. To keep things simple, we split up testing into two subsets: valid and invalid. Valid tests refer to tests that occur under correct input conditions. Invalid tests refer to tests that occur on bad input (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

### Valid Tests
