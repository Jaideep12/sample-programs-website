Welcome to the Fibonacci page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer
sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that
every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:

    1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...


## Requirements

For this sample program, each solution should leverage dynamic programming to produce this
list up to the nth term. For instance, `./fib 5` on the command line should output

```
1: 1
2: 1
3: 2
4: 3
5: 5
```

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't supply any input or the user supplies input that is not a number
(i.e. `./fib` or `./fib hello`, respectively).


## Testing

Every project in the Sample Programs repo should be tested. In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Fibonacci. To keep things simple, we split up testing into two subsets: valid and invalid. Valid tests refer to tests that occur under correct input conditions. Invalid tests refer to tests that occur on bad input (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

### Valid Tests

No 'Valid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).

### Invalid Tests

No 'Invalid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).
