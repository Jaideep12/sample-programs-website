Welcome to the Capitalize page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

This simple program picks a string and return the first letter of it in uppercase.


## Requirements

For this sample program, each solution should return the string with the first letter in uppercase.
In other words, do not change anything else about the input string.

```
string -> String
react -> React
java -> Java
car -> Car
a long string term -> A long string term
```

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't input a string.


## Testing

Every project in the Sample Programs repo should be tested. In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Projects. To keep things simple, we split up testing into two subsets: valid and invalid. Valid tests refer to tests that occur under correct input conditions. Invalid tests refer to tests that occur on bad input (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

### Valid Tests

### Invalid Tests
